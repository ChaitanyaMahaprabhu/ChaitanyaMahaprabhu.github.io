_ **Summary** _

It is said that Nityananda Prabhu is more merciful, more magnanimous, more munificent than Gauranga Mahaprabhu. So we are singing that song, nitai guna-mani amara, nitai guna mani…

1. Srila Lochana Dasa Thakura says, &quot;Nitai came to Gauda-desa with a flood of krishna-prema, with a flood of love of Godhead. He made the whole world inundated with that flood of prema.&quot;

 2. And with that flood, He came and inundated the whole land. Dubilo bhakata-gana dina hina bhase, those who are bhaktas, devotees they all drowned, they all blissfully drowned in that premer banya. But the dina hina, the fallen souls they floated, they floated!

 3. Nityananda Prabhu offers this pure love of Godhead, indiscriminately. It is pure love of Krshna that is rarely obtained. He distributes this prema with two hands! Two hands! He never discriminates whether one is patita or pamara, most degraded, qualified or not qualified. Brahmar durlabha prema, it is very difficult even on the part of Brahma to get this prema, but Nitai gives it indiscriminately.

 4. That prema is sindhu, like an ocean; karuna-sindhu, an ocean of mercy. It is said that Nitai broke down the strong embankment of that ocean of love. He completely devastated that dam. That ocean of love is an unlimited ocean. So then a flood came, it rushed in! It was a heavy rush that flooded into every home, ghare ghare bule prema-amiyar ban, and inundated the whole world.

 5. Srila Locan Dasa Thakura says, &quot;He is an unfortunate fellow who doesn&#39;t take shelter of Nitai and does not do the bhajana of Nityananda Prabhu, not begging for the mercy of Nitai. He willingly commits self-suicide, atma-ghati hoilo.

**HG Ruparaj Ram Prabhu tells:**

&quot; This bhajan is composed by HDG _ **Srila** __ **Locana Dasa Thakura** _ for the glorification of Nityananda Prabhu. In this bhajan he has written

_nitai guna-mani amar, nitai guna-mani
 aniya premer banya bhasailo avani_

Nitai has came to Gauda-desa with a flood of krishna-prema, with a flood of love of Godhead. He made the whole world inundated with that flood of prema. The Krishna-Balaram Pair of the Dwapara Yuga has again manifested as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu- Nityananda Prabhu in the Kali Yuga to give us the love of Krishna who is the supreme personality of Godhead. Nityananda Prabhu who is Balarama and is the first expansion of Krishna is the most merciful of all the incarnations of Krishna. We have already discussed a lot about Nityananda Rama Prabhu in our previous lectures. He is the adi-guru of the Krishna consciousness. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Ṭhākura Prabhupāda writes: &quot;Nityananda is the Primary Manifestive Constituent of the Divinity. Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is embodied. Nityananda is the servant-God.&quot;Krishna and Balarama is non-different as are Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu in their qualities. The only difference is their color of their skin and their mood which is master and service respectively.

Nityananda Prabhu is so merciful that he personally had gone door by door to request the fallen material people of the Kali-yuga to chant the holy name of Krishna and promise that if they do so then he will forever be their servant. How merciful is Nityananda Prabhu(Balarama) who is the actual controller of the whole universe and is the supreme personality of godhead in his own right, in whom the whole universe rests, who is the source of Narayana, who is called Ananta-shesha himself asking people to chant the holy name. Yesterday was the day of manifestation of Nityananda Prabhu, we discussed some glories of Nityananda Prabhu yesterday. Today we are in the last lecture of the series &#39;Importance of Remembering Krishna&#39; Lecture No.4. We shall discuss some slokas of Mukunda-Mala. The Book Mukunda Mala is posted in whatsapp, today we are going to start from the sloka 33 of the Mukunda Mala.

Before starting lecture , I shall pray to our spiritual master so that the right words come in my mouth at the right time and the right place.

_sri-caitanya-mano-&#39;bhistam sthapitam yena bhu-tale_
_svayam rupah kada mahyam dadati sva-padantikam_

**Meaning:**  I was born in the darkest ignorance, and my spiritual master opened my eyes with the torch of knowledge. I offer my respectful obeisances unto him.When will Srila Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?

_vande &#39;ham sri-guroh sri-yuta-pada-kamalam sri-gurun vaisnavams ca_
_sri-rupam sagrajatam saha-gana-raghunathanvitam tam sa-jivam_
_sadvaitam savadhutam parijana-sahitam krsna-caitanya-devam_
_sri-radha-krsna-padan saha-gana-lalita-sri-visakhanvitams ca_

**Meaning:** I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master and unto the feet of all Vaisnavas. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Srila Rupa Gosvami along with his elder brother Sanatana Gosvami, as well as Raghunatha Dasa and Raghunatha Bhatta, Gopala Bhatta, and Srila Jiva Gosvami. I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Krsna Caitanya and Lord Nityananda along with Advaita Acarya, Gadadhara, Srivasa, and other associates. I offer my respectful obeisances to Srimati Radharani and Sri Krsna along with Their associates, Sri Lalita and Visakha.

Let us now start the lecture by first reading the Sloka 33 of the Mukunda Mala Strotam. Of all the verses of the Mukunda-mālā-stotra, this one was the most beloved of Śrīla Prabhupāda. He frequently quoted it and sang it as a bhajana. On one of the first record albums His Divine Grace produced, he sang this śloka as a complete song. Devotees who served Śrīla Prabhupāda often heard him sing it as he went about his daily activities, or sometimes alone in his room. He also quoted it many times in his purports.

_ **kṛṣṇa tvadīya-pada-paṅkaja-pañjarāntam** _
_ **adyaiva me viśatu mānasa-rāja-haṁsaḥ** _
_ **prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye kapha-vāta-pittaiḥ** _
_ **kaṇṭhāvarodhana-vidhau smaraṇaṁ kutas te** _

_ **Meaning:** _ O Lord Kṛṣṇa, at this moment let the royal swan of my mind enter the tangled stems of the lotus of Your feet. How will it be possible for me to remember You at the time of death, when my throat will be choked up with mucus, bile, and air?

Now, the word prayāṇa-kāle in this [Bhagavad-gītā] verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Mahārāja Kulaśekhara, a great devotee, prays, &quot;My dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.&quot; The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. Mahārāja Kulaśekhara says to the Lord, &quot;Now my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name. Better let me die immediately.&quot; In the Eighth Chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa says that the exact moment of death is crucial: &quot;Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body,... that state he will attain without fail&quot; (Bg. 8.6). And in his purports Śrīla Prabhupāda repeatedly recommends chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra as the best process for remembering Kṛṣṇa at the time of death and successfully transferring oneself to the spiritual world.

The practical difficulty, brought up in Kulaśekhara&#39;s verse, is that although it is crucial to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death, that time also produces the greatest disruption of one&#39;s physical and mental functions. Śrīla Prabhupāda explained that death occurs when the body becomes so painful that the soul finds it unbearable to live in the body any longer. Therefore the paradox: At the time when we should be the most meditative, fixing our mind on Kṛṣṇa and preparing to transfer ourselves to the spiritual world, we are also faced with the greatest possible distraction in the form of agonizing pain. Thus here King Kulaśekhara prays to die now, in good health, so he will be able to absorb his mind in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa&#39;s lotus feet.The ācāryas have assured us that the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is our lifelong devotional activities and sentiments. Kṛṣṇa will not disqualify or discount our accumulated devotional activities due to a last moment epileptic fit or sudden heart failure. Nevertheless, we should always practice chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa so that we will be able to &quot;pass the test&quot; at the end.In the Īśopaniṣad (17), a devotee requests the Lord: &quot;[At the moment of my death,] please remember all that I have done for You.&quot; In his purport Śrīla Prabhupāda informs us that Kṛṣṇa does not have to be reminded; He is the witness within our heart, and He also desires—more than we do—that we come back to Him, back to Godhead. Considering the trauma of death and the dangerous quirks of fate, however, Mahārāja Kulaśekhara prays that he may die immediately rather than wait for old age, when he may forget Kṛṣṇa in the agony of his death throes.
