## _ **Summary** _

**(1)** My dear Lord Caitanya, please be merciful to me, because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?

**(2) **Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned, fallen souls, but I assure You that You will not find a greater fallen soul than me. Therefore, my claim is first.

**(3)** My dear Lord Nityananda, You are always joyful in spiritual bliss. Since You always appear very happy, I have come to You because I am most unhappy. If You kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also become happy.

**(4) **My dear Advaita Prabhu, husband of Sita, You are so kind. Please be merciful to me. If You are kind to me, naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityananda will also be kind to me.

**(5) **O Svarupa Damodara, personal secretary of Lord Caitanya, O six Gosvamis ó Sri Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami! O Lokanatha Gosvami, my beloved spiritual master! Narottama dasa also prays for your mercy.

**(6) **O Srinivasa Acarya, successor to the six Gosvamis! Please be merciful to me. Narottama dasa always desires the company of Ramacandra Cakravarti.

**HG Ruparaj Ram Prabhu tells:**

&quot;Today is a very special day for all the vaishnavas. Today is the appearance day of Advaita Acharya. We shall therefore discuss the glories of Advaita acharya. He is the most prominent of all the 4 companions of Sri Krishna Chaitanya which comprises the Pancha tattva together. He is the incarnation of sada-siva and Mahavishnu. We have discussed that Lord Chaitanya has descended to deliver the fallen souls of this material universe. But the main person behind Lord&#39;s most merciful incarnation is Advaita Acharya.

Advaita Acharya became increasingly saddened by looking the pursuit of materialistic goals by the fallen souls especially in the area around Navadipa, Mayapur those of whom are not using the wealth and capabilities they have not in the service of Krishna but in material engagements for their own sense gratification . Advaita acharya who is a pure and perfect devotee therefore concluded that the only solution was to offer prayers, begging his Supreme Lord Krishna to come as an Avatar and attract people back to the joy of the spiritual life. Advaita acharya then remembered an old verse of Vedas that told that if one worship Krishna with water of the Ganga mixed with Tulasi manjaris and leaves, then Krishna becomes so much in debt to that devotee that he will give any benediction to that particular devotee. He smeared the Salagrama-sila with the paste of sandalwood and musk and offered arati with incense and lamp. He worships the Salagrama-sila with water of the Ganga mixed with Tulasi manjaris and leaves. Tears of love incessently flow from His eyes as He meditates upon Krishna and sings His glories. He loudly sings the name of Krishna, praying to Him, &quot;O my Lord, deliverer of the universe, please manifest Your exceedingly merciful two-armed form in my vision. Please award me the proper vision.&quot; Due to the prayers of Sri Advaitacarya, Sri Caitanya appeared in the house of Jagannatha Misra in the womb of Mother Saci. In order to enjoy the association of Sri Advaita, Sri Caitanya sang the Holy Name of the Lord congregationally and danced with the devotees. Advaita acharya is the embodiment of compassion as it is through his prayers that we the fallen souls are getting the most precious jewel of all that the love for Krishna.

Srila Prabhupada when he was leaving India to preach outside the country to USA which was the instruction that Srila Prabhupada&#39;s Guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, he sought the blessings of Advaita acharya in tearful eyes by praying and visiting his house. We can get to know the spiritual position of each of the pancha tattva from the spiritual verse:

_panca-tattvatmakam krishnam bhakta-rupa-svarupakam bhaktavataram bhaktakhyam namami bhakta-saktikam_

**Meaning:** I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Kirishna, who is nondifferent from His features as a devotee, devotional incarnation, manifestation, pure devotee, and devotional energy.

Here we can see that each of the pancha tattva have a particular phrase associated with him

- _atmakam krishnam: (The Lord Himself i.e Krishna )Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu_
- _bhakta-rupa-svarupakam (The Expanion of Lord in the mood of serving i.e Balaram):Nityanada Rama Prabhu_
- _bhaktavataram (The Incarnation of Lord in the mood of Devotee): Advaita Acharya_
- _bhaktakhyam(The Devotee who has got the initiation i.e. Narada): Srivas Pandit_
- _bhakta-saktikam(Devotional energy of devotes manifested i.e Hladini Shakti): GadadharPandit_

We shall start today&#39;s class with by offering our obeisance to the lotus feet of Advaita acharya. We have already read some verses in Bhagavad Gita about the importance of remembering Krishna. Today we shall discuss some verses from Chaitanya Charitamrita. The verse we shall study is Adi 12.51

_mana duṣṭa ha-ile nahe kṛṣṇera smaraṇa kṛṣṇa-smṛti vinu haya niṣphala jīvana_

**Meaning:** When one&#39;s mind is polluted, it is very difficult to remember Kṛṣṇa; and when remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa is hampered, one&#39;s life is unproductive.

A devotee should always be alert, keeping his mind in a sanguine state so that he can always remember Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The śāstras state, smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇuḥ: in devotional life one should always remember Lord Viṣṇu. the remembrance of Krishna is the essence of all the teachings of the vedas compiled. In Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that

_sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo_
_mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca_
_vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo_
_vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham_

_ **Meaning** __:_ _I am seated in everyone&#39;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas._

_The mother of all Vedic hymns, Gayatri (which emanated as the sound of Shri Krishna&#39;s flute), along with the means for receiving and transmitting it, entered the lotus faces of Brahmä through his eight earholes, and Brahma achieved realization of the kama-gayatri mantra. The lotus-born Brahma was thus initiated by the flute-song of Bhagavan Shri Krishna, the original guru, and by that reformation he attained twice-born status. Therefore simply by remembering Krishan he got the knowledge of all the Four Vedas Combined. In the conclusion after completing the shiksa he has to get from Krishna to create the universe Bramha said in the Kali-santara Upanishad._

_hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare iti sodasakam namnam kali-kalmasa-nasanam natah parataropayah sarva-vedesu drsyate_

**Meaning:** The sixteen names of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra: hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare, hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare destroy all the inauspiciousness of the age of Kali. This is the conclusion of all the Vedas. (Kali-santarana Upanisad from Krishna Yajur Veda)

Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī also advised Mahārāja Parīkṣit, smartavyo nityaśaḥ. In the Second Canto, First Chapter, of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śukadeva Gosvāmī advised Parīkṣit Mahārāja:

_tasmād bhārata sarvātmā bhagavān īśvaro hariḥ śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca smartavyaś cecchatābhayam_

&quot;O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear, glorify and also remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.&quot; (Bhāg. 2.1.5) This is the summary of all the activities of a Vaiṣṇava, and the same instruction is repeated here (kṛṣṇa-smṛti vinu haya niṣphala jīvana). Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, avyartha-kālatvam: A Vaiṣṇava must be very alert not to waste even a second of his valuable lifetime. This is a symptom of a Vaiṣṇava. But association with pounds-and-shillings men, or viṣayīs, materialists who are simply interested in sense gratification, pollutes one&#39;s mind and hampers such continuous remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore advised, asat-saṅga-tyāga--ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra: a Vaiṣṇava should behave in such a way as to never associate with nondevotees or materialists (Cc. Madhya 22.87). One can avoid such association simply by always remembering Kṛṣṇa within his heart.

asat-saṅga-tyāga,--ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra &#39;strī-saṅgī&#39;--eka asādhu, &#39;kṛṣṇābhakta&#39; āra

**Meaning:** A Vaiṣṇava should always avoid the association of ordinary people. Common people are very much materially attached, especially to women. Vaiṣṇavas should also avoid the company of those who are not devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

One who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the reactions of unlimited sins, even if he chants indirectly [to indicate something else], jokingly, for musical entertainment, or even neglectfully. This is accepted by all the learned scholars of the scriptures.(Srimad-Bhagavatam, 6.2.14)

Hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare, hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare: This sixteen-name, thirty-two syllable mantra is the maha-mantra in the age of Kali by which all living beings can be delivered. One should never abandon chanting this maha-mantra and take to other so-called purificatory processes which are practiced by rascals, or engage in chanting other metrical compositions of the name of Krishna that are against the pure conclusions of the scriptures, or are filled with rasabhasa. About this divinely spiritual maha-mantra, which delivers one from material existence, the original guru, Lord Brahma, has said, kali-santararadi srutite, &quot;The srutis have declared this mantra to be the best means of deliverance in the age of Kali&quot;. Having all heard this from Brahma, the sons and disciples of Brahma, beginning with Narada, all accepted the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and, having meditated on it, attained perfection.&quot; (Ananta-samhita)Ananta-samhita is part of the Narada Pancaratra&quot;)

The maha-mantra is further mentioned in Chaitanya Charitamrita 1.7.83 (krishna-nama maha-mantrera), Chaitanya-charitamrita 3.9.56 (&#39;hare krishna, hare krishna&#39; kahe avisrama), Narada Pancaratra, etc.
